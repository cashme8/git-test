### í³– **The Book of Virtuous Manhood â€“ Chapter 1**

1. And the Lord said, *"I have made man in My image, to walk upright and to lead with wisdom, to work with his hands and guard his house with strength and honor."*

2. Blessed is the man who walks in integrity, who fears the Lord and delights in His ways; he shall be like a tree planted by rivers of courage.

3. A man is not known by the size of his strength, but by the weight of his character; his words build, his hands protect, and his heart is steadfast.

4. The foolish man chases vanity and boasts in power, but the righteous man humbles himself before the Lord and finds glory in obedience.

5. A virtuous man provides for his household, even when the night is long; he rises early with purpose and sleeps with a quiet conscience.

6. He speaks with wisdom and his mouth is filled with truth; he corrects in love, and disciplines with mercy.

7. He is a shelter in the storm, a shield to the weak, a voice to the voiceless; he stands when others fall, and prays when others curse.

8. He does not rule with cruelty, nor does he abandon his duty. He leads not with pride, but with service, as Christ washed the feet of His disciples.

9. Strength and meekness dwell in him side by side; his arms are strong, but his spirit is bowed before the Lord.

10. He honors his father and cherishes his mother. He raises his sons to be warriors of righteousness and teaches his daughters they are worthy of honor.

11. The Lord delights in the man who keeps His covenant, who walks in purity when no eyes see, and whose delight is in the law of the Lord.

12. For the path of true manhood is narrow and often heavy, but its end is life, and its reward is eternal.

13. Let every man examine himself, whether he be in the faith. Let him forsake foolishness and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.

14. For Christ, the perfect man, laid down His life â€” not for glory, but for love. So let every man love his neighbor as himself, and give more than he takes.

15. And the Lord shall say, *"Well done, My son, good and faithful servant. You have been strong and gentle, firm and kind, a man after My own heart."*
